# Wet Floor Effect
What this little bit of HTML and CSS does, is simulate the reflection on a shiny surface.

1. We first have an image, which we then replicate in a div which is placed directly below the image. 
2. The image in this new div is vertically flipped.
3. Next, the div is rendered translucent with a gradient so that the "reflection" is more opaque towards the base.
